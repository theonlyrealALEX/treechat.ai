# treechat.ai - A quickly deployable chatbot for querries on data that differs in each deployment and may be unstructured and unclean and requires logical reasoning in order to be usefull to the user.

## Description
Applications often contain unstructured data that does not encapsulate all aspects of a concept. For example, a simple keyword search in a restaurant database for 'fast food' may not result in 'McDonald's,' despite the association being apparent to a human. This gap between structured data and human-like understanding can be bridged with advanced AI solutions like GPT.

By applying Chat-GPT and feeding it all available data, we can emulate human-like cognitive abilities and improve the efficiency of data retrieval. These models can infer connections within data that are not explicitly defined, making them ideal for handling unstructured data.

A practical application for this solution is in the retail industry, specifically within shopping malls. Malls often contain diverse, obscure, and local stores, and their data might not be fully comprehensive. Furthermore, mall staff are often more adept at dealing with natural language inquiries rather than navigating databases.

In such situations, implementing treechat can enhance information retrieval, improve customer service, and provide more accurate responses to queries. By leveraging natural language understanding, we can create a more intuitive and efficient system that is capable of managing complex and incomplete data sets.
