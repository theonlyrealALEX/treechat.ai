# treechat.ai - A quickly deployable chatbot for querries on data that differs in each deployment and may be unstructured and unclean and requires logical reasoning in order to be usefull to the user.

## Description
Applications often contain unstructured data that does not encapsulate all aspects of a concept. For example, a simple keyword search in a restaurant database for 'fast food' may not result in 'McDonald's,' despite the association being apparent to a human. This gap between structured data and human-like understanding can be bridged with advanced AI solutions like GPT.
some applications have unstructered data that does include everything. e.g. mcdonalds implirs to a human fast food, but a regular querry wont find mcd if i querry for fast food.
solution
use gpt amd give it onlymenough data to infer everything.
application here: mall, not always complete data sets, obscure local stores, staff that is better with natrural language than databases.
